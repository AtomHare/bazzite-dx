# Bazzite Developer Edition

[![Build Bazzite DX](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-dx/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-dx/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is just bazzite, but with extra developer-specific tooling, aiming to match [Bluefin DX]() and [Aurora DX]() in functionality

`bazzite-gdx` will source from here and be focused for game development. 

## Acknowledgments
